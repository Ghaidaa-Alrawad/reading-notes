- Quality Assurance: Ensure the software meets requirements, maintaining high quality and reliability.

- Enhanced Security: Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities for a resilient application.

- Customer Satisfaction: Reduce errors for a smoother user experience, leading to increased satisfaction.

**Most Important Reason:** Quality Assurance, as it forms the foundation for a successful and reliable application.

## Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

Tasks and the back stack are like studying multiple books in a library. Each book represents an activity, and the stack of books is the back stack.

Switching tasks is akin to temporarily setting aside one book to answer a question and then returning to it, just like switching between tasks in Android
