# Java Basics - Class01 Reading 

## Strongly Typed Programming Language

Java is considered a strongly typed programming language. It enforces strict rules for interactions between different data types, enhancing code clarity, error prevention, and reliability.

## Primitive Data Types in Java

Java includes eight primitive data types:

- `byte`: 8-bit integer
- `short`: 16-bit integer
- `int`: 32-bit integer
- `long`: 64-bit integer
- `float`: 32-bit floating-point number
- `double`: 64-bit floating-point number
- `char`: 16-bit Unicode character
- `boolean`: Binary true or false value

These data types serve as building blocks for storing basic data in memory and are essential for fundamental operations and data structure creation.

## XKCD: Compiling

### Java Compilation

Java follows a compilation process where code in a special language is transformed into a readable format for computers. A well-crafted "book" of instructions allows computers to comprehend directions, though errors can still occur.

### JavaScript

In contrast, JavaScript communicates instructions directly to computers using a shared language. There's no intermediary "book-making" process as seen in Java. Computers process instructions in real time.

## Code Compilation and Correctness

Successful compilation confirms instruction quality, but errors can still arise during execution. Like well-written stories with flaws, compiled code might contain errors revealed only during execution. Thorough testing ensures intended functionality.
