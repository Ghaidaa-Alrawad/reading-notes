# Class 17 Reading

## In non-technical terms, describe what using OAuth can provide for your application.

OAuth provides a way for your application to allow users to access their accounts on other websites or platforms (such as GitHub or Google) without needing to share their login credentials directly with your application. It acts like a secure handshake between your app and the other services, ensuring that your app can access the necessary information on behalf of the user with their permission. So, OAuth adds a layer of security and trust when integrating external services into your application.
