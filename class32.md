## What makes an API RESTful?

An API is considered RESTful when it adheres to the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). These principles include stateless communication, a uniform interface (using standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-based identification (each resource is uniquely identified by a URI), and the ability to represent resources in various formats (such as JSON or XML).

## What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?

GraphQL offers a flexible and efficient way to query and manipulate data by allowing clients to request only the specific data they need. This reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data, leading to more efficient network usage. However, downsides may include a potential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with GraphQL, and in some cases, it might lead to complex queries affecting server performance if not managed properly.

## Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.

Serverless architecture is a cloud computing model where cloud providers dynamically manage server allocation and provisioning. In simpler terms, it means developers can focus on writing code without worrying about managing servers. It's like outsourcing the server management to the cloud provider. It's great for reducing infrastructure-related tasks and costs, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. There are trade-offs, such as limited control over networking and potential challenges with stateful applications. It's like having a convenient, on-demand server without the headache of maintenance.
