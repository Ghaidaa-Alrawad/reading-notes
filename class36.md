## What does Amplify Auth do for your application?

Amplify Auth provides an interface for authenticating users in the application. It handles the necessary authorization for other Amplify categories and comes with default support for Amazon Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool. By setting up and configuring Amplify Auth, we enable authentication capabilities in our app, allowing users to sign in and providing security for other features in your application.
