## Purely functional programming

### Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

In functional programming, changing the state of a data structure is discouraged.
The emphasis is on immutability, so instead of modifying data in place, new data structures are created with desired changes.

### Define purely functional programming.

Purely functional programming is a paradigm where programs are built as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Key characteristics include immutability, referential transparency, and avoidance of mutable state.

### How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?

Purely functional programming differs by promoting immutability, avoiding side effects, using functional composition, simplifying parallelism, utilizing persistent data structures, and offering a different problem-solving approach. It may require adjusting the coding mindset but can result in more maintainable code.
